**Goal:** Recording process times at digital workstations and deriving cost assessments.

**Project Execution:** The dental laboratory offers highly individualized products, reflected in the complexity of its manufacturing processes. Detailed process step analysis was conducted for each product, allowing the formation of product groups for further evaluation. Subsequent process time recording (using REFA methodology) and calculation of personnel and machine hourly rates enabled a cost assessment of digital manufacturing processes.

**Result:** Transparency in process costs and production times through structured process analysis and product group calculation—providing a foundation for strategic resource and pricing decisions.

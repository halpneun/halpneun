**Goal:** Product-specific recording of process times, providing a basis for improved planning reliability regarding personnel utilization and lead times.

**Project Execution:** The project focused on the packaging and shipping area, from the end of the manufacturing process to customer delivery. This included a detailed analysis of packaging processes and the recording of associated process times, following REFA methodology. Progress was coordinated with the client in bi-weekly report meetings. As the management was international and English-speaking, all project results were provided in English.

**Result:** Analysis and mapping of product-specific process times in packaging and shipping to create a solid foundation for personnel and production planning. The collected data was presented to international management and now forms the basis for planning and capacity decisions.

HALPNEUN Solutions supports medium-sized manufacturing companies exactly where digital projects often get stuck: limited internal resources, unclear requirements, and missing coordination between production, IT, and external service providers.

<ul class="check-list">
    <li>Filling resource gaps in business departments and IT</li>
    <li>Flexible support on an hourly basis – no long-term commitments</li>
    <li>Clear requirements gathering and translation into technical specifications</li>
    <li>Project planning, test coordination, and documentation</li>
    <li>Acting as interface between business departments, IT, and service providers</li>
    <li>Supporting rollouts and conducting employee training</li>
</ul>

This ensures the successful introduction of digital manufacturing systems such as MES, CAQ, or MDE – from the first analysis workshop to a smooth go-live.

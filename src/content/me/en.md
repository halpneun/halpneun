title: About Me
---

I was born in Herzberg am Harz and my roots are in Göttingen since my bachelor's degree. I completed my master's degree in Leipzig. I also like to travel – in Germany and beyond. In my free time, I am a triathlet and I love to spend my holidays on the race bike – in Switzerland, Italy, or wherever the road takes me. For me, triathlon is not just about effort, it is also a team sport: I compete with ASC in the triathlon league and like to train with others. To balance sport and work, I play the piano. I am always open to new things and enjoy combining different interests.

For more than ten years, I have worked on production projects – from planning to execution – in different roles, teams, and environments. During my studies, I worked on practical projects: as project manager of a Formula Student team making electric race cars, as a bachelor’s student at Porsche introducing an AI system to check signs in production, as a consultant for process documentation and cycle times, and as a master’s student and project manager at Ottobock planning and implementing an automated guided vehicle.  

For the last three years, I have been responsible at Ottobock for planning and running different production systems in global factories. My approach is simple: a project is only finished when it works – the vehicle moves, the system is productive, or the solution is in place. I take responsibility, find practical solutions, and help teams get real results.  

With HALPNEUN Solutions, I use this experience to support medium-sized companies. I help where there are few resources, uncertainties, or stalled digital projects. I guide projects from idea to completion, make sure they have an impact, and motivate teams to try new ways and use digital opportunities successfully.  

You can count on me.  

Best regards,

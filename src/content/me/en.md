title: About Me
---
I am originally from Herzberg am Harz and studied in Göttingen and Leipzig. I have been living in Göttingen again for over three years. In my free time, I enjoy traveling and taking on new challenges. I especially like cycling trips on vacation, which help me clear my mind and see things from a new perspective. I am also a passionate triathlete and compete for ASC Göttingen in the Triathlon League. Even though triathlon is an individual sport, teamwork is very important to me: training together, reaching goals, and celebrating successes. I bring the same team spirit to my work with clients. Being curious, open to new ideas, and organized helps me create practical and lasting solutions together with my clients.

For more than ten years, I have worked on production projects – from planning to execution – in different roles, teams, and environments. During my studies, I worked on practical projects: as project manager of a Formula Student team making electric race cars, as a bachelor’s student at Porsche introducing an AI system to check signs in production, as a consultant for process documentation and cycle times, and as a master’s student and project manager at Ottobock planning and implementing an automated guided vehicle.  

For the last three years, I have been responsible at Ottobock for planning and running different production systems in global factories. My approach is simple: a project is only finished when it works – the vehicle moves, the system is productive, or the solution is in place. I take responsibility, find practical solutions, and help teams get real results.  

With HALPNEUN Solutions, I use this experience to support medium-sized companies. I help where there are few resources, uncertainties, or stalled digital projects. I guide projects from idea to completion, make sure they have an impact, and motivate teams to try new ways and use digital opportunities successfully.  

You can count on me.  

Best regards,  
Lukas Papenfuß

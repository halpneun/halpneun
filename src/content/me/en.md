As an industrial engineer (M.Sc.) with a focus on production engineering, I support digital transformation projects along the entire supply chain – from requirements analysis and system selection to global implementation. My focus is on bridging production, IT, and external partners – always results-oriented, interdisciplinary, and with a focus on sustainable efficiency improvements.

- Project management of global MES/CAQ rollouts
- Optimization of manufacturing and master data in SAP-PP
- Planning and implementation of intralogistics systems (AGV)
- Introduction of data-driven production processes (MDE / AI-supported systems)
